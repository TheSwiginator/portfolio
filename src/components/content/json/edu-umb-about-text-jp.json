"This course is a continuation of JAPAN 101, and assumes the knowledge of Japanese covered in it. Students who studied Japanese elsewhere and wish to take the course need to demonstrate a similar level of competency. All four language skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) will be covered. In addition to new elements of grammar, students will learn about 50 new kanji."
