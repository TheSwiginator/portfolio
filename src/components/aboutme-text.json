"My name is Blake Moody and I am nineteen years old from Swampscott, Massachusetts. I am currently a student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, where I am studying Computer Science. I recently graduated from Essex North Shore Agricultural and Technical School, where I studied in the Information Technology program. In my spare time, (if I'm not listening to music, reading manga, or playing video games) I often find myself working on expanding my web development skills by creating interesting and practical web applications. I hope to bring my passion for technology to the field by pursuing a career in Software Engineering."
